## Lateral movement

> Hopping from one machine to another (horizontally) with the same permission level

In order to move laterally, we need to have either credentials or a hash to pass for remote authentication...

### psexec

> Problem: Requires administrator rights on windows 7 and above!

Can be used to pass-the-hash, use leading `0` (32) if you are missing the Lan Manager hash

```
meterpreter> set smbpass 00000000000000000000000000000000:8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c
```

### RDP as alternative

> If you have a username and password but no administrator rights, try either escalating your privileges or look onto the machine via `RDP` 

```bash
rdesktop -u <domain>\\<user> -p "password" 127.0.0.1
```
